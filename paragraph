This HTML code creates a basic Government Scheme Finder web page. It has a header displaying the app name, a search bar where users can type keywords or select a category to filter schemes, and a list of scheme cards showing the scheme name, category, eligibility, and benefits. The JavaScript function allows users to search and filter the schemes dynamically, showing only the cards that match the search term or selected category. The CSS styles give the page a clean and modern look with spacing, colors, and card shadows. Overall, it is a simple prototype to help citizens find government schemes easily.
